__DGFEMC__ was created by Dorival Piedade Neto & Sergio Persival Baroncini Proença
to present to graduate students a possible OOP design for a GFEM code, using 
1D structural models.

__DGFEMC__ was developed based on __FEM__, which is a simple 1D Finite Element Method
code. The aim is to show how to change a __FEM__ code to insert __GFEM__ features in
the code.

__Programming Language:__ _Python_

__Dependence libraries:__ _NumPy_ and _matplotlib_

__Usage:__

The sources are available at the folder _src/FEM_ and _src/GFEM_.
To run the examples just type in the command prompt:

```
   python example_file.py
```
